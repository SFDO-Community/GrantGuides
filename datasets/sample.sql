Our flagship event is an annual Plant Out, held every autumn. At this event, hundreds of volunteers plant trees in local parks. [Org] staff oversee tree planting, including enrolling and briefing volunteers; co-ordinating volunteers with correct planting conditions and supplies; and liaising with local landowners to gain necessary permissions.
